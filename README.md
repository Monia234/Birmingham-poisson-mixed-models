# birminghamr_mixed_models
example of a mixed poisson regression analysis (korean dyad data)

We'll use this markdown file for the hands-on session. The data is taken from Korean dyadic interactions in two conditions â€” with a friend and with a professor. The model we'll fit estimates the count of honorifics for both of these conditions. A mixed model is needed because there are repeated samples per participant as well as repeated samples per item. This mixed model will be a mixed Poisson regression model because the main response variable is a count variable.
